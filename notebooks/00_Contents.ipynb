    "# Defeasible Reasoning Methods implemented in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a series of notebooks showing one possible way of implementing algorithms for Rational Closure, Relevance Closure and Lexicographic Closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks are divided into their smallest respective parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Datastructures](\"notebooks/01_Datastructures.ipynb\")\n",
    "    + Classes and methods used for all other notebooks.\n",
    "2. [Ranked Interpretations](\"notebooks/02_Ranked Interpretations.ipynb\")\n",
    "    + Algorithms for computing the minimal valuation ranking and the statement ranking\n",
    "3. [Rational Closure](\"notebooks/03_Rational Closure.ipynb\")\n",
    "    + Algorithm to compute if a statement is in the rational closure of a knowledge base.\n",
    "4. [Basic Relevance Closure](\"notebooks/04_Basic Relevance Closure.ipynb\")\n",
    "    + Algorithms to compute the $\\alpha$-justifications of a formula in respect to a knowledge base, and if a statement is in the basic relevance closure of a knowledge base.\n",
    "5. [Minimal Relevance Closure](\"notebooks/05_Minimal Relevance Closure.ipynb\")\n",
    "    + Algorithm to compute if a formula is in the minimal relevance closure of a knowledge base.\n",
    "6. [Lexicographic Closure](\"notebooks/06_Lexicographic Closure.ipynb\")\n",
    "    + Algorithms to compute if a formula is in the lexicographic relevance closure of a knowledge base. Both versions (CNF and DNF) are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing:\n",
    "What we could not yet explore is how to update the knowledge base according to the revision operator. We hope to define notebooks for that in the future.\n",
